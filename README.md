# Animation-Library
Animation library for blender to save selected keyframes and mark it as an asset, so it could be used later in asset browser. Took a lot of inspiration from Sybren A. St√ºvel's built-in pose library. I'm making this because I feel like I need this kind of add-on now, although I think blender devs are gonna do a built-in of it soon.

It eliminates the hustle to import rigs with animation loops that we need from other blender files.
